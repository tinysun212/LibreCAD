---- About LibreCAD ----
LibreCAD is a 2D CAD drawing tool based on the community edition of QCad (www.qcad.org).
LibreCAD has been re-structured and ported to qt4 and works natively cross platform between OSX, Windows and Linux.
See www.librecad.org

---- UNIX and OSX users ----
Unzip or checkout a version of LibreCAD into a directory.
CD into that directory and follow these instructions:

# Build makefile and compile LibreCAD

qmake librecad.pro
make

---- Ubuntu/Debian users ----

Make sure you have the qt-4 SDK installed
Install the qt4 SDK by executing the following commands:

$ sudo apt-get install g++ gcc make git-core libqt4-dev qt4-qmake libqt4-help qt4-dev-tools libboost-all-dev libmuparser-dev

Alternatively, you make sure you have deb-src lines enabled in your sources.list file, and run,

$ sudo apt-get build-dep librecad

For git see also:

NOTE 1: On systems (Ubuntu??) You might need to run qmake-qt4 instead of just qmake

---- Windows Users ----

Download a copy of QT SDk < 4.8.0, 4.7.4 for example from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/ 
Download boost 1.48 from https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.48.0/
unzip into c:/boost/1_48_0 (in this directory you will find boost root directory, INSTALL, index, Jamroot etc.. etc). If the location of your boost installation is different, you should edit the BOOST ENVs in the file settings_windows.pro accordingly, before building LibreCAD.

After installation, start qtCreator and load LibreCAD.pro,
from the the build menu select 'Build All'


---- OSX USERS ----

After that install QT and a new gcc, at mimimum you properly need gcc 44
Install a version of Qt < 4.8.0, 4.7.4 for example
sudo port install gcc46 qt4-creator-mac qt4-mac boost

When installed run to build a makefile
qmake librecad.pro -r -spec mkspec/macports
